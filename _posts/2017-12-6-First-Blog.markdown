Hi This is my first blog.  

![avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andy-lee0913/andy-lee0913.github.io/master/assets/images/plane.jpg)

### The intent of this blog

I have been looking for a place where I can take a record of what I think on my specialty or life.  When I was in high school, I was used to taking noted with a notebook.  With a notebook, you can easily take it with you.  But here came another shortcoming of the notebook, which was that the notebook could be lost or hard for me to calssify.  So I was inspired to build a blog to take the place of notebooks.  

### What this blog will be about

I will write blogs on life and machine learning algorithms.
