<h3>My hobby</h3>

	I have a wide range of interests.  In terms of sports, I like badminton and have ever accepted professional training.  In terms of music, I like playing piano and harmonica. My favorite singer/musician is Liu Huan, 澤野弘之 and 梶浦由紀. I like cooking for delicious dishes. During leisure time, sometimes I will kill time by watching some Japanese Anime.

<h3>My hometown</h3>
<p>
  I am from a small city called Yishui in the south central part of Shandong Province of China. Yishui is rich of historical and modern culture, and it is famous for its tourism. On the one hand, Yishui is a historical city, so it is not surprising that there are some places of interests which were built in Tang Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period.  On the other hand, besides historical sceneries, there are also modern sceneries as well, such as city park, library and gym etc. Welcome to Yishui for a tour!
